# Image Definitions

## Purpose
This spec describes the ImageDefinition entity — the configuration record for a container image that can be built and deployed. ImageDefinitions have four concrete subtypes (MCP, Interceptor, Adapter, Application), each with its own spec.

Status: **Implemented**

## Key Terms
- **ImageDefinition**: A persistent record that defines a container image — its source, version, metadata, and build configuration. Identified by a UUID.
- **Image source**: Either a pre-built Docker image reference (`DockerImageSourceDto`) or a Git repository with a Dockerfile (`GitDockerfileImageSourceDto`).
- **`$type` discriminator**: The Jackson polymorphism field (`"mcp"` | `"adapter"` | `"interceptor"` | `"application"`) that determines which subtype is created or returned.
- **Build status**: The latest build outcome for a given image definition version (`buildStatus` field).
- **Semantic version**: The `version` field must follow semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`).
- **Grouped view**: An `ImageDefinitionViewDto` that groups all versions of the same image definition name under a single entry, with a `selectedId` and an `availableVersions` list.
- **ImageType**: Domain enum with values MCP, ADAPTER, INTERCEPTOR, APPLICATION — there are no NIM or INFERENCE image definition subtypes.

## Base Fields

All image definition subtypes carry these fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | Yes (response only) | Generated on creation |
| `name` | String | Yes | 2–255 chars, alphanumeric/space/underscore/hyphen only |
| `version` | String | Yes | Must be a valid semantic version (`@ValidSemanticVersion`) |
| `description` | String | No | |
| `source` | ImageSourceDto | Yes | DockerImageSource or GitDockerfileImageSource |
| `license` | String | No | Max 255 chars |
| `createdAt` | Instant | Yes (response) | Set on creation |
| `updatedAt` | Instant | Yes (response) | Updated on modification |
| `topics` | List\<String\> | No (request) / Yes (response) | Free-form topic labels. Nullable on input; always present (possibly empty) in responses. Each topic: non-blank, ≤255 chars, no leading/trailing whitespace. Values are not from a fixed enum — the topics endpoint returns the distinct union across all image definitions. |
| `buildStatus` | ImageStatusDto | No | Latest build status, null if never built. Values: NOT_BUILT, BUILDING, BUILD_FAILED, BUILD_SUCCESSFUL |
| `author` | String | No | |
| `allowedDomains` | List\<String\> | No (request) / Yes (response) | Per-definition domains allowed during image build (build-time network access). Nullable on input; always present (possibly empty) in responses. See `domain-whitelist` spec for the full domain access control layering. |
| `imageBuilder` | ImageBuilderDto | No | Override the build engine: BUILDKIT or BUILDKIT_ROOTLESS (default: BUILDKIT_ROOTLESS) |

## Requirements

### Requirement: List image definitions
The system SHALL return all image definitions, optionally filtered by subtype.

Status: **Implemented**

#### Scenario: List all
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/images/definitions` is called without filters
- **THEN** all image definitions of all types are returned

#### Scenario: Filter by type
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/images/definitions?type=MCP` is called
- **THEN** only image definitions with `$type: mcp` are returned

### Requirement: Get image definition by ID
The system SHALL return a single image definition including all subtype-specific fields.

Status: **Implemented**

#### Scenario: Existing definition
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called
- **THEN** the full image definition is returned including all base and subtype fields

#### Scenario: Non-existent ID
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called with an unknown ID
- **THEN** the system responds with 404

### Requirement: Create image definition
The system SHALL create a new image definition of the subtype indicated by `$type`.

Status: **Implemented**

#### Scenario: Successful creation
- **WHEN** `POST /api/v1/images/definitions` is called with a valid body including `$type`, `name`, `version`, and `source`
- **THEN** a new image definition is persisted and returned with a generated `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`

#### Scenario: Missing required fields
- **WHEN** `POST /api/v1/images/definitions` is called without `name`, `version`, or `source`
- **THEN** the system responds with 400

#### Scenario: Invalid semantic version
- **WHEN** `POST /api/v1/images/definitions` is called with a `version` that is not a valid semantic version
- **THEN** the system responds with 400

### Requirement: Update image definition
The system SHALL update an existing image definition by ID. The set of fields that may be mutated depends on the current `buildStatus`:

- **NOT_BUILT, BUILD_FAILED, BUILD_STOPPED** — full replacement is allowed. Any update resets `buildStatus` to `NOT_BUILT` because the prior build artifact (if any) is no longer valid against the new configuration.
- **BUILD_SUCCESSFUL** — only **meta fields** may change: `description`, `author`, `topics`, `license`. The update is applied in place; `buildStatus`, `imageName`, `builtAt`, and build logs are preserved, and the built image remains valid. Any change to a build-affecting field (`name`, `version`, `source`, `allowedDomains`, `imageBuilder`, or a subtype-specific field such as MCP `transportType`) is rejected with HTTP 400.
- **BUILDING** — the image definition is read-only. Any update is rejected with HTTP 400.

`allowedDomains` is compared order-insensitively (multiset semantics) during build-affecting detection — a cosmetic reorder of the same domains is treated as no change, mirroring `DeploymentService.isApplicableForCiliumNetworkPolicyUpdate`.

The configuration import path (`POST /api/v1/configs/import`, see `export-import` spec) bypasses the `BUILD_SUCCESSFUL` restriction and uses full-replacement semantics regardless of the prior build status.

Status: **Implemented**

#### Scenario: Full update when not BUILD_SUCCESSFUL or BUILDING
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called with a valid body and current `buildStatus` is `NOT_BUILT`, `BUILD_FAILED`, or `BUILD_STOPPED`
- **THEN** the image definition is fully replaced, `buildStatus` is reset to `NOT_BUILT`, and a new `updatedAt` timestamp is set

#### Scenario: Meta-only update when BUILD_SUCCESSFUL
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called while current `buildStatus` is `BUILD_SUCCESSFUL` and only meta fields (`description`, `author`, `topics`, `license`) differ from the stored record
- **THEN** the meta fields are updated; `buildStatus`, `imageName`, `builtAt`, and build logs are preserved

#### Scenario: allowedDomains reorder is not a build-affecting change
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called while current `buildStatus` is `BUILD_SUCCESSFUL` and `allowedDomains` contains the same entries as the stored record in a different order (meta fields may also change)
- **THEN** the update is treated as meta-only and applied in place; `buildStatus` is preserved

#### Scenario: Build-affecting update when BUILD_SUCCESSFUL is rejected
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called while current `buildStatus` is `BUILD_SUCCESSFUL` and any build-affecting field (`name`, `version`, `source`, `allowedDomains` membership, `imageBuilder`, or a subtype-specific field) differs
- **THEN** the system responds with 400 and the stored record is unchanged

#### Scenario: Update rejected while BUILDING
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called while current `buildStatus` is `BUILDING`
- **THEN** the system responds with 400

#### Scenario: Non-existent ID
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called with an unknown ID
- **THEN** the system responds with 404

### Requirement: Delete image definition
The system SHALL delete an image definition asynchronously via the component cleanup service. The response is HTTP 204 (accepted for deletion). Deletion cascades to all dependent resources.

**Cascade chain:** Image definition deletion triggers async cleanup of all deployments referencing this image definition. Each cascaded deployment is undeployed from Kubernetes and then deleted from the database. Build-related Kubernetes resources are also cleaned up.

Status: **Implemented**

#### Scenario: Successful deletion
- **WHEN** `DELETE /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}` is called
- **THEN** the deletion is initiated asynchronously and the system returns HTTP 204

#### Scenario: Cascade to dependent deployments
- **WHEN** an image definition is deleted that has deployments referencing it
- **THEN** all deployments with that `imageDefinitionId` are queued for async deletion (undeploy + DB removal)

#### Scenario: Cascade to Kubernetes resources
- **WHEN** a cascaded deployment deletion runs
- **THEN** the deployment is undeployed from Kubernetes, K8s resources are cleaned up, and the deployment record is deleted from the database

### Requirement: Get grouped image definition views
The system SHALL return image definitions organized by name, grouping all versions of the same name into a single `ImageDefinitionViewDto` entry. An optional `type` filter narrows results.

Status: **Implemented**

#### Scenario: Grouped view returned
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/images/definitions/grouped` is called
- **THEN** image definitions are returned grouped by name; each group includes `name`, `selectedId`, and `availableVersions` (list of `ImageDefinitionViewElementDto`)

#### Scenario: Grouped view filtered by type
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/images/definitions/grouped?type=MCP` is called
- **THEN** only groups for MCP image definitions are returned

### Requirement: Get image versions with statuses by name
The system SHALL return all versions of an image definition matching a given name, including their build statuses. An optional `type` filter is supported.

Status: **Implemented**

#### Scenario: List versions
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/images/definitions/{name}/versions` is called
- **THEN** all versions for the given name are returned; each entry includes `id`, `name`, `version`, `status`

#### Scenario: Versions filtered by type
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/images/definitions/{name}/versions?type=MCP` is called
- **THEN** only versions matching that subtype are returned

### Requirement: Revision rollback
The system SHALL expose `POST /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}/revision/{revision}/rollback` to restore an image definition's stored configuration to its snapshot at the supplied audit revision. Rollback is permitted only when current `buildStatus` is `NOT_BUILT`, `BUILD_FAILED`, or `BUILD_STOPPED` — `BUILDING` and `BUILD_SUCCESSFUL` reject with HTTP 400 because a built image definition may already be referenced by deployments; operators must instead create a new version and re-point deployments via `change-image`. The rollback always persists via the regular update path, which resets `buildStatus` to `NOT_BUILT`. Build artifacts (`imageName`, `builtAt`, build logs) are NOT separately cleared by rollback — they cannot be non-null in rollback-eligible states under normal flow (`ImageBuildRunner` rejects rebuilds of `BUILD_SUCCESSFUL`, so `failBuild` can never run against a built image), so no clearing step is necessary. The rollback path enforces the `(name, version)` uniqueness constraint and the build-status guard. The service does NOT pre-check identical state; rolling back to a revision whose snapshot already equals the current state may record a fresh audit revision. Cascade to dependent deployments is NOT performed — their stored configuration is untouched.

If the image definition no longer exists under `{id}` but a snapshot exists at the supplied revision, rollback **re-creates** it (in `NOT_BUILT`) rather than returning 404 — letting an operator revert a deletion in a single call. Because image-definition ids are server-generated UUIDs (the persistence-layer generator overwrites any supplied id on insert), the re-created definition receives a **NEW id**; clients MUST read the returned DTO for it. Re-creation goes through the standard create path, so the snapshot's `(name, version)` must still be free — a collision rejects with HTTP 409. Re-creation is side-effect-free with respect to the deleted generation: its leftovers (build jobs / config maps / pushed images, and any still-pending component-removal marker) are all keyed by the **old** id, which the re-created definition never reuses, so they cannot affect it and are cleaned by the scheduled cleaner in due course. Rollback still returns HTTP 404 when the id never had a recorded state at-or-before the revision.

Status: **Implemented** (Implemented via 020-revision-rollback)

#### Scenario: Rollback restores configuration from rollback-eligible state
- **WHEN** `POST /api/v1/images/definitions/{id}/revision/{revision}/rollback` is called on an image definition in `NOT_BUILT`, `BUILD_FAILED`, or `BUILD_STOPPED` with a valid revision
- **THEN** the stored configuration matches that revision's snapshot, `buildStatus` is reset to `NOT_BUILT`, and HTTP 200 is returned

#### Scenario: Rollback rejected when built or building
- **WHEN** the rollback endpoint is called on an image definition with `buildStatus = BUILDING` or `BUILD_SUCCESSFUL`
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 400 and the image definition is unchanged; the message instructs the operator to create a new version instead

#### Scenario: Rollback rejected on name+version collision
- **WHEN** the rolled-back name+version pair matches another existing image definition
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 400 and the image definition is unchanged

#### Scenario: Rollback re-creates a deleted image definition under a new id
- **WHEN** the rollback endpoint is called for an `{id}` that has been deleted but had a snapshot at the supplied revision, and the snapshot's `(name, version)` is currently free
- **THEN** the image definition is re-created in `NOT_BUILT` under a new server-generated id (leftovers from the deleted definition stay keyed to the old id and are left to the scheduled cleaner) and HTTP 200 is returned with the resulting DTO carrying the new id

#### Scenario: Rollback re-creation rejected on name+version collision
- **WHEN** the rollback target is a deleted image definition whose snapshot `(name, version)` is now taken by another existing image definition
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 409 and no image definition is created
